Disjoint Set Union
==================

.. automodule:: tree.dsu
   :members:
   :special-members: __str__
   :exclude-members: main

.. rubric:: The Amortized Time

In this case, The Inverse `Ackermann Function`_ :math:`\alpha(n)` is in fact
treated as a constant. So the amortized time complexity of the two operations
of the :py:class:`UnionFind` can be optimized to :math:`O(1)`.
