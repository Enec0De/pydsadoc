Undirected graph
    An undirected graph is a graph where the edges hav no direction.

Directed graph
    A directed graph is a graph where the edges have a specific direction.

Network
    A network is a graph with weights or costs associated with its edges.

Adjacency Matrix
    Adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a finite graph, where
    the rows and columns correspond to the vertices of the graph, and the
    entries indicate whether pairs of vertices are adjacent.

Adjacent Point
    Adjacent points are vertices in a graph that are directly connected by an 
    edge.

Degree
    The degree of a vertex in a graph is the number of edges incident to that
    vertex.

Out Degree
    The number of edges leaving the vertex.

In Degree
    The number of edges entering the vertex.

Complete Graph
    A complete graph is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of 
    distinct vertices is connected by an edge.

Adjacency List
    An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists userd to represent a 
    finit graph, where each list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in
    the graph.

Connected
    In a graph, two vertices are connected if thers is a path between them.

Path
    A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices where each vertex is adjacent
    to the next one in the sequence.

Path Length
    The number of edges in a path.

Simple Path
    A path with no repeated vertices.

Loop
    A path that starts and ends at the same vertex.

Connected Graph
    A graph where there is a path between every pair of vertices.

Connected Component
    It's a maximan connected subgraph of a graph, meaning it's a connected part
    of the graph that can't be made larger by adding more vertices or edges from
    the orginal graph.

Strongly Connected
    In a directed graph, a pair of vertices are strongly connected if there is a
    directed path from one vertex to the other and vice versa.

Strongly Connecte Graph
    A directed graph where every pair of vertices is strongly connected.

Strongly Connected Component
    A minximal strongly connected subgraph of a directed graph.
