Maximum Subsequence Sum
-----------------------

The main question is to solve: For a given sequence :math:`A_k`, evaluate the
function

.. math::

   f(i,j) = \max{\left\{\sum_{k=i}^{j} A_{k}\right\}}.

Some Simple Complementation
---------------------------

There are four classic algorithms, and you may also want to read the source
code:

.. automodule:: maxsubseqsum
   :members:
   :member-order: bysource
